# ArtBreakerGame

### Description:
This breakout game was created in just 9 days and 10 nights by a team of 5 code cadets. It's an exciting and classic arcade-style game built in Java using the SimpleGraphics library. The goal of the game is to destroy all the bricks by maneuvering a paddle left and right to bounce a ball and prevent it from passing the paddle. But there's a twist - once you've cleared all the regular bricks, a boss hidden behind them will start shooting at you from the top!

### Languages and Libraries:
The project is developed in Java and utilizes the SimpleGraphics library for graphics manipulation. You can find the SimpleGraphics library here: SimpleGraphics on GitHub.

### About:
This project was created during the Academia de CÃ³digo bootcamp, between May and August 2023.
